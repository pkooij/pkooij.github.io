        <p>
          In July I went to my first conference: Robotics Science and Systems in
          Delft. The experience was inspiring and I met a lot of nice people.
          The conference began with a day of workshops, where I chose to
          participate in the GenAI workshop. It featured a range of fascinating
          discussions on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and the use of robotic
          foundation models in manipulation, which captured my interest. The
          next three days included a lot of networking. I had very nice
          conversations with researchers and professionals from various
          universities and companies. These days were complemented by more
          detailed presentations that spanned a broad array of topics, from
          navigation to control systems. This immersive environment helped me
          realize that my interests align strongly with manipulation, robot
          design, foundation models, HRI, and imitation learning. Entering the
          conference, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly
          surprised by how much I enjoyed the experience. It was very enjoyable
          to be at the forefront of the state of the art and to explore the
          unresolved questions that need to be answered. Overall I think the
          robotics AI field is the most interesting space right now with a lot
          of promises but also still a lot that needs to be figured out and I am
          very excited to be part of this!

        <h2>On building robots with 3D printing</h2>
        <p>
          Building and designing robots require a few different disciplines, CAD
          drawing, choosing the right transmission system (motor + gearing),
          prototyping with for example 3D printing, electrical design, and
          software integration. Luckily while studying Mechatronics I learned
          quite a few of these things but applying them in the real world can
          still be challenging at times. During prototyping for example, it is
          essential to keep in mind the Design for manufacturability (DFM)
          aspects, which limit producable shapes and materials. An easy way to
          prototype without having the full picture of DFM is making use of 3D
          printing, which is currently quite cheap and reliable. To come back to
          building robots, a few key aspects are I think important when creating
          robots that eventually do useful things in a safe way, utilizing AI.
          First of all, it is important that robots are not very expensive. This
          is needed because a lot of advances in AI and robotics, especially in
          the manipulation area, focus on imitation learning. The data in
          imitation learning is largely (besides simulation) coming from
          teleoperated episodes. And thus it is a numbers game. More (good) data
          is better models and cheaper robots mean more robots for a certain
          price, which enables acquiring more data.
          <br>
          <br>
          The second important aspect is ease of use when teleoperating the
          robot. If the robot mimics the biology of a human arm in terms of
          links and DOF then it is easier for humans to instruct the robot
          through intuitive movement and by example. It also gives the
          possibility to use internet data of humans moving which can more
          easily be mapped to the robot's joints if they are similar to a human
          arm.
          <br>
          <br>
          The other aspects should be safety and reliability. Safety is
          important if the robot works alongside humans. This usually is
          achieved with torque sensors on output shafts or at the end effector.
          My personal view is that robots that have less inertia together with
          good current sensing of the motor can achieve safety, in a more
          cost-effective way than robots with higher gears and dedicated torque
          sensors. Reliability on the other hand is possibly harder to achieve
          with a cheaper robot. I think here the important thing is choosing
          reliable transmission without a lot of moving parts although this of
          course is the opposite of what a robot does (it moves, and moves).
          <br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, I built 2 robotic arm prototypes and here I want to share
          a few of my lessons learned.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold">Blue like the sky</p>
        <p>
          The first robot arm I build was based on the Berkeley Bleu robot arm
          [1]. This robot arm adheres to a few principles. It is relatively
          cheap, has 7 DOF just like a human arm, has relatively low inertia,
          and is easy to manufacture with a 3D printer. I modeled everything in
          CAD and began prototyping, taking hints about the design from videos
          and from the paper. After a few iterations prototyping, testing,
          choosing the right motor controller, more printing, etc. I was able to
          put everything together. Below is my version of the Blue robot arm.
        </p>
        <div class="image-row">

          <img src="/image6.7a0aa684.png">
        </div>
        <p>
          During initial testing however and also once everything was together I
          quickly found out that the design, while it's good, is not optimal for
          my use case. The differential that is used is very handy, it combines
          the torque of two motors for 2 DOFs, however, the gears in the
          differential are not very precise when 3D printed. Additionally, the
          last DOFs in the arm are overpowered because each module (3 in total)
          is the same which helps in simplicity. But because they also use the
          same motors the torque in the last DOFs are over-engineered and are
          too large for what is needed, besides the increased weight that this
          brings is not advantageous. Both these problems are solvable (larger
          3D printed gears or metal gears, and smaller motors in the last DOFs),
          and with some more thought and adaptation can this design be
          transformed into a very capable robot. I however moved towards another
          type of robot to learn what tendons can possibly bring. I still want
          to give credit to the designers of the Blue robot because it is very
          nicely thought out and generates some interesting points and thoughts
          on cheap and simple robot design for embodied AI.

          the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next exploration in robot design was led by the design of the
          dynamic and low inertia robot LIMS I found from IRIM LAB KOREATECH.
          This lightweight tendon-driven robot arm is inspiring to watch on
          Youtube and its safety by design feature, because of these tendons is
          inspiring. However, the first and second iterations look quite hard to
          manufacture and assemble as seen in the LIMS1 paper [2] and videos on
          YouTube. The third iteration (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7INPj1hdnyA&t=2s">YouTube link</a>) however looks simpler in both its design and possibly in its
          manufacturing. This design features tendons in each of its joints
          which is I think somewhat overkill because the shoulder joints don't
          reap the benefits such as the arm joints do, which make use of tendons
          routed towards the upper arm to bring the weight of the motors more
          towards the base. Aside from this design decision, I think the usage
          of tendons in the elbow and for the lower arm and wrist are very
          cleverly thought out. Thus I went on to try to create a similar design
          to learn more about tendons and to find out how hard they actually are
          to work with. The LIMS design makes use of a virtual rolling contact
          joint for the wrist, which in the last version only consists of two
          bar linkage mechanisms, aside from the actuation bar. The other
          versions use three linkages and this was also the type I implemented
          (see image below). This mechanism is quite elegant, although not very
          stiff without strong tendons. I found out that using universal joints
          together with 3D printing can deliver quite an easy-to-make and simple
          virtual rolling contact joint, compared to a joint that uses bearing
          and axis for this connection. Furthermore, to enable motor placement
          in the upper arm, the tendons are wired through the elbow via a
          mechanism that keeps the tendons the same length when the elbow moves.
          This is cleverly designed but requires quite a few pulleys (4 for each
          DOF) which makes 16 pulleys in total (2 stationary). The tendons are
          connected via a winding pulley to the motors which is a very easy way
          to create a transmission that is quite high and has low backlash and
          friction. This is very beneficial, but the pain point is in the
          tensioning of the tendons. This is harder to do but if managed I think
          tendons-driven robotics can for a lower payload offer great
          characteristics. In my design, I however didn’t have enough time to
          make them work reliably but with enough iterations, I still think they
          can be a great way to create a transmission especially when you want
          to create low-cost and possibly 3D printed robots.

          So to conclude I learned a great deal about hardware design,
          trade-offs, and design for manufacturability. The more opinionated
          look on robot hardware that I developed, helps me in creating new
          robotic hardware for use in research and application of embodied AI.
