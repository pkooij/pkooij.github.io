        <p>
          In July I went to my first conference: Robotics Science and Systems in
          Delft. The experience was inspiring and I met a lot of nice people.
          The conference began with a day of workshops, where I chose to
          participate in the GenAI workshop. It featured a range of fascinating
          discussions on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and the use of robotic
          foundation models in manipulation, which captured my interest. The
          next three days included a lot of networking. I had very nice
          conversations with researchers and professionals from various
          universities and companies. These days were complemented by more
          detailed presentations that spanned a broad array of topics, from
          navigation to control systems. This immersive environment helped me
          realize that my interests align strongly with manipulation, robot
          design, foundation models, HRI, and imitation learning. Entering the
          conference, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly
          surprised by how much I enjoyed the experience. It was very enjoyable
          to be at the forefront of the state of the art and to explore the
          unresolved questions that need to be answered. Overall I think the
          robotics AI field is the most interesting space right now with a lot
          of promises but also still a lot that needs to be figured out and I am
          very excited to be part of this!
